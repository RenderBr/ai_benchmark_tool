# Product Requirements Document: AI Prompt Testing Web App

## 1. Purpose and Scope

**Purpose**
Build a web application that allows users to submit or curate prompts, run those prompts across multiple popular AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, PaLM, Llama, etc.), and have the models—and potentially additional automated evaluators—score or rank the responses. This tool helps prompt engineers, AI researchers, and developers compare model performance side by side and iterate on prompt design quickly.

**Scope**

* **Front-end:** Web interface for submitting prompts, viewing results, comparing scores, and drilling into response quality metrics.
* **Back-end:** Orchestration layer that sends each prompt to configured AI model endpoints (via API), collects responses, applies automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, human-likeness proxy, or custom metrics), and stores results.
* **Admin/Configuration:** Dashboard or configuration file where new AI model endpoints can be registered (API keys, rate limits, model-specific parameters).
* **Analytics/Reporting:** Aggregate data on prompt performance over time, trending prompt patterns, model rankings for categories (e.g., creativity, factual accuracy).

This PRD does **not** cover:

* Fine-tuning of AI models themselves.
* Deep human annotation pipelines (beyond simple automated metrics).
* Offline or downloadable desktop clients.

## 2. Background and Motivation

Many organizations and individuals experiment with multiple AI models in parallel. However, comparing “apples to apples” in prompt quality is hard:

* Different APIs have different response formats.
* Manual comparison is time-consuming and error-prone.
* Automated metrics exist but are fragmented.

A unified tool that:

1. Accepts a prompt,
2. Distributes it to multiple models,
3. Gathers and normalizes responses,
4. Scores/ranks them on defined criteria,

…would drastically reduce iteration time for prompt engineering and help teams pick the best model for specific use cases (e.g., summarization, code generation, creative writing, factual Q\&A).

## 3. Objectives and Success Metrics

### 3.1 Objectives

1. **Rapid Comparison**: Enable users to push a prompt to N models simultaneously and receive results within seconds.
2. **Objective Scoring**: Provide automated, repeatable scoring on aspects like relevance, coherence, factual accuracy, creativity, and response length.
3. **Extensibility**: Allow new models or scoring modules to be added without rewriting core logic.
4. **Transparent Ranking**: Display side-by-side comparisons with clear breakdowns of each score component.
5. **Usability**: Simple UI/UX so non-expert users can start comparing prompts with minimal learning curve.

### 3.2 Success Metrics (First 6 Months)

* **Time to First Comparison**: < 2 minutes from sign-up → prompt tested on at least two models.
* **Prompt Evaluations Processed**: ≥ 5,000 prompts/month.
* **User Retention**: ≥ 20% of registered users perform > 3 prompt comparisons/week.
* **Accuracy of Automated Scoring**: Internal audits show ≥ 85% correlation between automated “factual accuracy” metric and human reviewer judgments on 500-sample audit.
* **System Uptime**: ≥ 99.5%.

## 4. Assumptions & Constraints

* **API Access**: The team has valid API keys and rate-limit allowances for each target AI model (e.g., demand-based pricing might apply).
* **Budget**: Moderate budget to pay for API usage (per-call charges).
* **Scoring Modules**: Initial scoring will rely on open-source evaluation libraries (e.g., Hugging Face’s metrics, BLEU/ROUGE) plus simple heuristics (length normalization, toxicity filters).
* **User Base**: Primarily prompt engineers, AI researchers, and small-to-medium enterprises.
* **Deployment**: Hosted on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure) using a managed Kubernetes or serverless architecture.

## 5. User Personas

1. **Prompt Engineer (PE)**

   * **Role:** Works at a startup or AI consultancy.
   * **Goals:** Rapidly prototype and benchmark prompts across available LLMs.
   * **Needs:** Fast turnaround, clear scoring on “creativity” vs “accuracy,” exportable results for reports.

2. **AI Researcher (AR)**

   * **Role:** Academic or industry researcher studying model alignment and performance.
   * **Goals:** Compare new and existing models, run large batches of prompts, gather metrics for publication.
   * **Needs:** Bulk-upload functionality, API access to run automated experiments, historical data tracking.

3. **Product Manager (PM)**

   * **Role:** Oversees an AI-powered feature in a consumer app.
   * **Goals:** Decide which model gives best ROI (cost vs performance).
   * **Needs:** Cost/per-call breakdown, aggregated model rankings for different categories (e.g., “code style,” “conciseness”).

4. **Developer / Engineer (Dev)**

   * **Role:** Integrates model selection logic into production pipelines.
   * **Goals:** Programmatically fetch scoring results, integrate best prompt/version into CI/CD.
   * **Needs:** Well-documented REST API, webhook notifications when evaluations finish, JSON outputs.

## 6. User Stories & Use Cases

### 6.1 Core User Stories

1. **Single Prompt Quick Test**

   * *As a Prompt Engineer, I want to paste a prompt into a text field, pick 3 models from a list, and click “Evaluate,” so that I can instantly see each model’s response and score.*

2. **Bulk Prompt Batch Testing**

   * *As an AI Researcher, I want to upload a CSV of 1,000 prompts, assign them to a “Temperature=0.7 Summarization” experiment, and schedule batch evaluations overnight, so that I can analyze results the next morning.*

3. **Automated Benchmarking**

   * *As a Developer, I want to call an API endpoint `/evaluate` with JSON describing a prompt and list of models, and receive back a JSON object with responses and scores, so I can integrate evaluation into a continuous optimization pipeline.*

4. **Historical Results & Comparison**

   * *As a Product Manager, I want to view trending performance of Model X vs Model Y on “Customer Service” prompts over the last 30 days, so I can make a data-driven decision for our roadmap.*

5. **Custom Scoring Module**

   * *As an AI Researcher, I want to define a new evaluation metric (e.g., “Sentiment Consistency”) and plug it into the scoring pipeline so that my new metric is included in the side-by-side comparison.*

6. **Cost Analysis**

   * *As a Product Manager, I want to see the per-call cost and total spend for each model evaluated, so I can weigh performance gains against budget constraints.*

### 6.2 Edge / Negative Use Cases

* **API Rate Limits Exceeded**: System should capture errors from external AI APIs, mark evaluations as “failed,” and retry after a back-off window or notify user.
* **Malformed Prompt**: If user submits an empty prompt or one exceeding model length limits, show clear validation errors.
* **Scoring Library Failure**: If a scoring metric crashes on an unexpected input (e.g., empty response), fallback to a default score of “0” or “N/A” and log details for maintenance.

## 7. Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Prompt Submission

* **FR-1**: Accept single-prompt text input with optional metadata tags (e.g., “domain,” “use-case”).
* **FR-2**: Accept bulk prompt upload (CSV, JSON, or XLSX). Each row must have a prompt ID and text.
* **FR-3**: Allow users to select a set of AI models from a dynamic list; each model entry includes name, version, supported parameters (e.g., temperature, max length), API endpoint, and cost per token.

### 7.2 Evaluation Orchestration

* **FR-4**: Validate prompt length vs each model’s token limit before sending.
* **FR-5**: For each prompt and selected model, make an API call to the model’s endpoint with configurable parameters.

* **FR-7**: Record API call metadata: request payload, response payload, timestamp, latency, error codes (if any).

### 7.3 Automated Scoring & Ranking

* **FR-8**: Integrate open-source evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, etc.) to compute automated scores for each response.
* **FR-9**: Support custom scoring modules via Plug-in interface: each module must implement an interface (e.g., `score(response_text, reference_text) → numeric_score`).
* **FR-10**: Normalize scores to a common scale (e.g., 0–100) and optionally apply weights (e.g., 30% coherence, 40% relevance, 30% factual correctness).
* **FR-11**: Generate a composite “overall” score per (prompt, model) combination, along with sub-scores per category.
* **FR-12**: Rank models by composite score and allow sorting by sub-scores in UI.

### 7.4 Results Display & Interaction

* **FR-13**: Show a results table/grid where each column is a model and each row is a prompt (or vice versa).
* **FR-14**: Provide expandable details: clicking on a cell shows full response text, scoring breakdown, and any warnings (e.g., “Low factuality”).
* **FR-15**: Support filters (e.g., show only responses with composite score ≥ X, or filter by prompt tags).
* **FR-16**: Allow side-by-side view of up to N responses for the same prompt (e.g., vertical split).

   3. UI shows a spinner and “Evaluation in progress…” bar.
   4. Once complete, UI navigates to Results page with table pre-filtered to this prompt.

2. **Bulk Upload Flow**

   1. User selects “Batch Evaluate,” downloads template CSV or drags-and-drops file.
   2. System validates CSV format: ensures “prompt\_id” and “prompt\_text” columns exist.
   3. User maps CSV columns if needed → selects models → clicks “Start Batch.”
   4. UI shows a progress bar with count of completed vs pending evaluations.
   5. User receives email/webhook callback on completion or views Results page to see aggregated results.

3. **Admin Model Addition Flow**

## 10. Technical Architecture

### 10.1 High-Level Components

1. **Front-End (React or Vue)**

   * Component library: Tailwind CSS + headless UI or Material UI.
   * Routing: React Router (if React) or Vue Router.
   * State management: Redux or Vuex for global evaluation state.

2. **API Gateway / Web Server**

   * Framework: Node.js + Express or Python (FastAPI).
   * Responsibilities: Authentication, rate-limiting, request validation, user management, routing to orchestration service.

3. **Evaluation Orchestrator (Microservice)**

   * Language: Node.js (TypeScript) or Python.
   * Responsibilities:

     * Receive evaluation requests.
     * Push jobs into a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS).
     * Spawn worker instances or serverless functions to call AI model APIs.
     * Invoke scoring modules on responses.
     * Write results to database.

4. **Worker Pool**

   * Each worker: fetch job from queue, call model API, run scoring modules, push results to DB.
   * Auto-scale based on queue depth.

5. **Database**

   * Primary: PostgreSQL or MySQL (hosted).

     * Stores: User accounts, model configurations, scoring module metadata, evaluation metadata (timestamp, prompt\_id, model\_id, parameters, cost, latency), and normalized scores.
   * Secondary (optional): ElasticSearch or a time-series DB (e.g., InfluxDB) for analytics queries (trend charts).

6. **Storage for Logs & Artifacts**

   * S3 (or equivalent) for storing raw responses, especially if responses can be large (e.g., 10k tokens).
   * Central logging system: e.g., ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a managed service like DataDog.

7. **Scoring Modules**

   * Hosted as pluggable Docker containers (or Lambda functions) that adhere to a common interface: input → JSON with sub-scores.
   * Examples:

     * BLEU/ROUGE evaluator container (Python).
     * BERTScore evaluator container (Python).
     * Grammar/Spell-Check container (Node.js).
   * Orchestrator loads and invokes them in sequence.

8. **Authentication & User Management**

   * OAuth 2.0 / JWT tokens.
   * Password reset flows, 2FA (optional).

9. **Notifications & Alerts**

   * Email service (SES, SendGrid) for notifying users when large batch jobs complete or if errors occur.
   * Webhooks (optional) for users to integrate results into their own systems.

### 10.2 Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

1. **User** → **Front-End**: Submits prompt(s).
2. **Front-End** → **API Gateway**: `POST /api/evaluate`.
3. **API Gateway** → **Orchestrator**: Validates request, enqueues job in **Job Queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ).
4. **Worker** pulls job → checks model configurations → calls each **AI Model API** asynchronously.
5. When model API returns:

   1. Worker runs each enabled **Scoring Module** on the model’s response.
   2. Worker aggregates sub-scores into **Composite Score**.
   3. Worker writes record to **Database** and optionally stores raw response in **Object Storage**.
6. **API Gateway** gets notified (via DB trigger or callback) that job is complete.
7. **Front-End** polls or subscribes (WebSocket) to `GET /api/results/{job_id}`.
8. **Front-End** receives JSON with responses, scores → renders results.
9. **Analytics Module** queries database periodically (cron job or materialized views) to update aggregated charts.

### Phase 3: General Availability & Enhancements (Ongoing)

* **Add more models**: integrate additional public and private model endpoints (e.g., open-source LLM hosted on user’s GPU).
* **User-defined scoring scripts**: sandboxed environment for users to upload Python scoring logic.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: optional UI for human raters to override automated scores.
* **Model fine-tuning integration**: future feature to retrain or fine-tune existing models based on best prompts discovered.
* **Mobile app** (Phase 3+): lightweight mobile interface focusing on quick evaluations.

**No sugarcoating**:

* Expect ongoing maintenance of AI model adapters—APIs change, pricing/limits shift, and new models emerge.
* Automated metrics are inherently noisy; disclaimers are needed that scores are proxies, not ground truth.
* Running hundreds or thousands of prompts will incur significant cost; provide clear budgeting tools.
* Achieving perfect correlation with human judgments is impossible; target > 85% is realistic.
* Scaling may become expensive; continuous monitoring of cloud costs is mandatory.
* Early adopters may push bizarre prompts that break scoring modules—plan for robust error handling and user education.

This PRD outlines the bare-bones requirements to build a functional, extensible, and direct comparison tool for AI prompt testing. Adjust milestones and staffing based on team size and priority trade-offs.
